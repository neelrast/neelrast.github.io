										I had the great fortune of working alongside Neel at a large
										radiology practice, where we collaborated on various machine
										learning projects. Neel is the kind of person that we should
										all aspire to be: a hard-working, collaborative colleague
										and ML tool expert who is always up-to-date on the latest
										trends and techniques. His work ethic is admirable, often
										taking long nights to make sure projects are completed on
										time and to the highest standards. What truly sets Neel
										apart is his creative ingenuity. Whenever we faced a
										challenge, Neel's inventive spirit would take over, and time
										and time again we would be able to solve even the most
										complex problems with unique solutions. ...

										Neelesh is an ambitious, creative student and colleague
										while we were at at St. John's University. One of Neelesh's
										most impressive traits is his genuine enjoyment of
										brainstorming and idea/concept development. I always felt I
										could pitch ideas and thoughts to Neelesh without worrying
										about judgement or immediate criticism. He always provided
										an opportunity to explore an idea- to hypothesize and
										examine its potential. Neelesh is also receptive to
										considerations of his own ideas, and is always open to
										hearing how things can be improved or reimagined.

										Neel has an incredible mind as a visionary, but more
